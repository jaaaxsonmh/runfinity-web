                      Any time you apply for beta access to Runfinity, you are
                      making an offer to Runfinity to be apart of the

                      Runfinity may respond to an enquiry, approved access will
                      not be considered accepted until Runfinity dispatches the
                      product and supplies the required details of the service.
